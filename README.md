# Granular-Spherical-Clustering
The present study proposes an approach to optimize the computational complexity of the spectral clustering algorithm based on the granular sphere structure. Additionally, it proposes an approach to optimize the hyperparameters in the spectral clustering process using the black-winged kite optimization algorithm.
# TCN
In the route recommendation stage after clustering, the model uses multi-scale feature fusion to analyze the relationships between scenic spots' geographical locations and uses spatio-temporal convolutional networks to capture the patterns of tourists' stays at scenic spots.
# Data
The data provided is for demonstration purposes only.
